I am a Computer Science undergraduate at [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/) (Class of 2026) pursuing PhD opportunities.

My research focuses on overcoming I/O bottlenecks in billion-scale vector retrieval through novel indexing structures and hardware-aware optimizations.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanfeng Zhang](https://neuzhangyf.github.io/) of iDC-NEU Lab from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/), Northeastern University.

You can find my CV here: [Pufan Zuo's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
