I am a Computer Science undergraduate at [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/) (Class of 2026) .

My research focuses on:

**Data Systems:** Privacy-preserving Data Systems, Machine Learning for Systems, Cloud Database, Graph Processing, Vector Database, Data Integration and Cleaning, Distributed OLTP/OLAP, Query Optimization

**Data Science:** Intelligent Data Systems, Big Data Analytics, Interpretable Machine Learning, ETL, Data Lakehouse

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yanfeng Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangyf/en/index.htm) of iDC-NEU Lab from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/), Northeastern University.

I am currently a Database Engine R&D Engineer at CelerData (powered by StarRocks), working on next-generation OLAP database optimizations and ecosystem tooling. I actively maintain and contribute to the StarRocks open-source community, a high-performance MPP database with 10K+ GitHub stars.
