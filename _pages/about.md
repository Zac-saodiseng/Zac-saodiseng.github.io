## Research Statement

I am a Computer Science undergraduate at Northeastern University (Class of 2026) pursuing PhD opportunities in **Database Systems** and **Distributed Computing**. My research focuses on overcoming I/O bottlenecks in billion-scale vector retrieval through novel indexing structures and hardware-aware optimizations.

### Core Research Directions

1. **Vector Database Architectures**  
   Developing update-efficient graph indexes for streaming vector data (as in arXiv:2503.00402v1)

2. **Hardware-Software Co-design**  
   Leveraging SPDK and RDMA for low-latency storage access

3. **ML Infrastructure Optimization**  
   Building high-throughput pipelines for LLM feature stores
