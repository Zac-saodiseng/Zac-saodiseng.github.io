  <p>
    I am currently a <strong>Ph.D. student in Computer Science</strong> at the
    <a href="https://www.cs.utah.edu/" target="_blank">Kahlert School of Computing</a>,
    <a href="https://www.utah.edu/" target="_blank">University of Utah</a>, Salt Lake City, UT,
    advised by Prof.
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/muzhang82/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Prof. Mu Zhang</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    My research focuses on <strong>AI and LLM/VLM-based agent security</strong>, with particular interest in 
    security challenges arising in AI workflows where machine learning models are tightly intertwined with 
    code logic. I study emerging attack surfaces in LLM/VLM-powered agents, such as web-based and tool-using agents, 
    and investigate how adversaries can manipulate perception, reasoning, memory, and action pipelines to 
    induce harmful or unintended behaviors (e.g., deceiving agents into executing incorrect actions in real-world tasks). 
    More broadly, I am interested in understanding new security risks introduced by AI-enabled applications 
    and AI-driven software development processes.

    Before my Ph.D., I earned my <strong>B.E. in Computer Science</strong> from 
    <a href="https://www.neu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>, China, 
    advised by Prof. <a href="https://neuzhangyf.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Yanfeng Zhang</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have industry experience as a software and systems engineer at 
    <a href="https://celerdata.com/" target="_blank">CelerData</a>, 
    <a href="https://ir.kuaishou.com/" target="_blank">Kuaishou</a>, 
    and <a href="https://www.meituan.com/en-US/about-us" target="_blank">Meituan</a>, 
    focused on large-scale data systems, infrastructure, and engineering-driven problem solving.

    <span style="color: #d60000;">I am open to research collaborations and internship opportunities</span> 
    in AI security, LLM/VLM-based agents, and secure AI systems. 
    Please feel free to reach out via email or WeChat if you are interested in collaborating.
