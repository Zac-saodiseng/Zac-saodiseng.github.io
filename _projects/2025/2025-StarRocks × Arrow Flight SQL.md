description: >-
  Built a high-performance data transfer channel using Apache Arrow Flight SQL in StarRocks 3.5.1.
  It removes extra conversion and serialization overhead from traditional JDBC/ODBC, enabling
  zero-copy, low-latency data delivery. Tests show up to 160× speedup, greatly improving
  performance for data science, lake analytics, and machine learning workloads.
